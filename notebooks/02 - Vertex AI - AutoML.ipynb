    "####  **Interpretation of the Bar Chart**\n",
    "The Bar Chart above shows the feature attributions for a particular prediction made by the model. Here's a detailed interpretation of the chart:\n",
    "- Horizontal Axis (Attribution Score) : The horizontal axis represents the attribution scores, which indicate the contribution of each feature to the model's prediction.\n",
    "- Positive scores suggest that the feature contributes positively to the prediction (i.e., increasing the likelihood of the predicted class).\n",
    "- Negative scores suggest that the feature contributes negatively to the prediction (i.e., decreasing the likelihood of the predicted class).\n",
    "- The vertical axis lists the features from the dataset.\n",
    "- Each bar corresponds to a feature and its length represents the magnitude of its attribution score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example : (Your results could be different)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top Contributing Features:**\n",
    "- V17: The feature **V17** has the highest positive attribution score, indicating it is the most influential feature in driving the model's prediction towards the predicted class.\n",
    "- V4 : Similarly, **V4** is also a significant positive contributor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features with Lower Impact :**\n",
    "-  Features like **V16** and **V19** have negative attribution scores, indicating they negatively impact the prediction. This means that higher values of these features reduce the likelihood of the predicted class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neutral or Low-Impact Features :**\n",
